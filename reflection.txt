Learning to Code (Again!) Diary 2023

June 4 2023:
- Foundations Sprint 1
- Revisited Command Line Basics
- Learning to use Git and GitHub Again

It was very daunting to get started. But once I started revisiting the Foundations course content, things have started to come back to me. Phew! I feel a lot less intimidated.

Stuff to remember:
- Use imperative language for git commits. E.g. Use "Make dog bark" (imperative) instead of "Makes dog bark" or "Made the dog bark".
